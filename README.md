==============

Final project for CSCI400: Programming Languages, Spring 2014.

A simple calculator written in Scheme to exemplify several features of
the language. This was written for the [GNU

The following features of Scheme are used:

* [exception handling](main.scm#L9-L18)
* [hygenic macros](main.scm#L9)
* [lambda expressions](main.scm#L13)
* [tail call optimization](main.scm)
* [functions](main.scm)
